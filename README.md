# How to Use HackMD and this *'wierd'* markdown?

1) Dont panic. Its easier than you think.
2) Use the ==?== button on the top, to view all options of syntax supported. 
    - Its markdownbased, but you can also just use the WYSIWYG elements on top.
    - Also, the Editor literally helps you and writes the confusing symbolks on its own.

3) To Embed a picture - just drag-and-drop it into the editor. That will upload it, and also embed it directly.

## Option to Sync this to Github in realtime

HackMD offers the option to sync any changes every 10 minutes onto github, for transparency and edit history. ==@phylo== would that be an option ?  

> ==Here some example how it would work:==
> We Simply setup the GitHub sync to a new realtime-collab iota-community 'organization' repository - all changes would appear automatically, saving the revisions of change, every 10 minutes.
